## Accelerate Prep Work: My first website
My website is a simple one that consist of 3 pages:
1. _Welcome page_
   * This is basic a simple page with a photo as my background.
   * The page also have 2 links to the wrapped by a `<div>` tag which links to the 2 other pages
   * At the bottom have included links to Linkedin, Facebook and Github and a Copyright.
2. _About me_
   * I use this page to put a bit more information about me. Content include Basic Biography, Description, Hobbies, Dream
   * I have also included a nav bar on top which is also present in my photo, the picture on the left is a link that brings you back to the welcome page and the right side has a link which takes you to the my photo page.
   * I used the container-fluid class and grid system provided by bootstrap in the main section to provide scaling to the boxes when the brower changes size but I have not optimize the scaling of the words.
3. _Photo Album_
   * The header and footer in this page is the same as ones found in the other 2 pages (header not included in welcome page with minor adjustment.
   * In the main section, I used bootstrap's container class and grid system to insert the photos in each column and try to make sure the picture fit in each column (except the panorama ones).
   * In order for the photos to load quicker, I compressed the photo online such that the size is smaller without affecting the quality much.
   * Since the photos are minimized in the page, I have setup a lightbox using the work of [Lightbox by Lokesh Dhakar](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) so that used can see the photo in their maximized form when they click on the photo.
   * I have also put the photo into groups based on the event and used a jquery's hide and show function to filter photos belonging to the same group.
  
I hope this website could showcase some of the things I learned from the material provided by the HTML/CSS/JS resource provided by Accelerate HK.
